    "# Building Data Pipeline With Spark and Airflow to Study The Relationship Between Temperature and Traveling into US Ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Engineering Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I94 immigration data from US government contain the travel entries into United States from other countries that includes their entry_date, departure_date, visa_categrory, visa_type etc. How do we corrlate the travel entry data with other data to understand what factors that can affect traveling into USA?  I used Spark and Pandas to create data processing pipeline to ETL data for several tables. I used Airflow to mange the workflow and task dependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data pipelie produce finally aggregated data into a set of analytic tables that can be used for studying the relationship between international traveling and city temperatures in USA. The data was used for plotting tfor visualization of the relationship between temperature and traveling counts in top 20 cities in USA. The picture below shows plots for 9 cities.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cities except warm weather cities, traveling increases almost in linear fashion with the increase of the temperature.  Warm weather cities are exceptions. Since the weather was never really cold in warm cities, traveling is also less prohibitive in these cities, resulting less traveling reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources/Dictionary:\n",
    "In this project, we have data from the following sources:\n",
    "* airport (**airport-codes_csv.csv**)\n",
    "* city demography (**us-cities-demographics.csv**)\n",
    "* temperature (**Global_city_temperatures.csv**)\n",
    "* additional label information (**I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS**). **\"i94port.txt\"** and **i94state_code.txt** were obtainted from I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS file. \n",
    "* external data: **\"uscities_simplemap.csv\"** from (https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities). I used the external data, due to incorrect longitude and latitude data in Global_city_temperatures.csv file, that map New York City to New Jersey and Chicago to Wisconsin. Geo-data was used to select the right cities after joining the data with the same city names (use < 180 km  as the filter). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **i94 immigration tables**: Since I can not download immigration table files directly from Udacity workspace. I open these files in jupyter notebook at the workspace as suggested inside the notebook and save them as parquet files and download to my local machine. I kept the original file names for the parquet folder names, but under data folder such as (\"/home/jun3/src/data/i94_jan16_sub.parquet/\"). I have all 12 month data under data folder. Airflow schedules runs with should follow the same scheme as the origianl data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data need to be extracted, cleaned and transformed to be suitable for analyses. I choose to use **Spark**, **Pandas** and **Airflow** as main technical tools for the project. \n",
    "* **Spark** is good for:\n",
    "* processing large datasets in both distributed and parallel fashion.\n",
    "* Spark/Hadoop can run on low cost commodity hardwares.\n",
    "* Spark can create table schema on the fly, very convenient to create pipelines for different analytical purposes  \n",
    "* Spark dataframe contains many tools for cleaning/processing and some tools for basic machine learning. \n",
    "* Spark allows output data to be saved in parquet format that is columnar and compressed. Both of these characters speed up query process. File comprssion also saves storage and query cost if queried through cloud based service such as Amazon Athena. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pandas** is good tool for smaller datasets:\n",
    "* Very flexible for cleaning the data.\n",
    "* Good for plotting with external libaries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Airflow** is a great tool for managing ETL processes:\n",
    "* It manages the job/task flow and dependencies, make sure certain tasks start first and finish before starting other processes.\n",
    "* It schedules data processing with execution_date. Timestamps of the Airflow scheduling allow only certain data fitting with certain date requirement that can only be processed one at the time, that effectively partitions large data into smaller amounts, avoiding large amount of data overwhelming the system. \n",
    "* Airflow Scheduling backfills runs of previous timestamp.\n",
    "* It has web based visualization tools making the process very clear, giving color coded warning if something fails. It also contains logs for debugging and SLA for managing service deadline. \n",
    "* It has tools to create connections to cloud based services (such as AWS services).  \n"

    "#### Data cleaning and processing\n",
    "\n",
    "I also include **immg_table_test_Apr.ipynb** that provides an example of data cleaning and primary exploratory data analysis for immigration table, and merging with airport_i94port_join_table for primary traveling analysis.  I checked numbers of null value in each columns through counting_null_number_inColumns() function in helper.py. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Data cleaning and processing is rather tedious. The general process involves:\n",
    "* (1) Get rid unrelated columns. df.drop(column_names)\n",
    "* (2) Drop or fill null values.  df.dropna()\n",
    "* (3) Get ride of duplicated data.  Use df.dropDuplicates() in Spark. df.drop_duplicates() in pandas\n",
    "* (3) Extract and create new columns from existing data if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* I documented the detail data cleaning process as comments inside submiitted python scripts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ETL process need to clean and preserve most of the original data. The analysis wouldn't be accurate if too much data get deleted.  In this cases, I preserved about 89% of data from original monthly i94_immigration data.   \n",

    "I intend to create Data Lake with Spark due to flexibility to create specific schemas for specific analytic purpose.

Spark is compatible with ingesting large amount of data into dataframe, can process data in distributed and parallel fashion that is fast and effiecient.  It also provides data cleaning tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Immigration data are provided monthly from the government. The current schedule runs are monthly match the time frequency of data immigration tables. However, if the data is much larger. The provided immigration data will be further partitioned by day(even hour) instead of month. In such cases the running schedule will be daily.   \n",

    "3. If the data populates a dashboard that must be updated on a daily basis by 7am every day, the DAG will be running daily with service contract in airflow with SLA (service level agreement) linked to email accounts to report SLA misses. To prevent SLA misses, the pipeline can be run by a larger and more powerful clusters if needed. \n",

If users locate at different region, data also need to be copied into buckets at different regional zones for fast data access.  "
